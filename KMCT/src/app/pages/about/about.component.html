                <u> CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE</u>
            </h2>
            <p class="fs-5 messageP">
                 As we complete 21 years in 2022, I look back with pride at what we have achieved. 
                I would like to thank our students-past and present, parents, our recruiters, and our 
                staff for having stood by us. I am reminded of a lovely quote by Emily Dickinson:

                “We turn not older with years but newer every day.”

                Technology has profoundly changed education. Technology enables newer and 
                more innovative means of communication and collaboration. We realize the 
                compelling need to stay abreast with these changes. KMCT is metamorphosing. 
                Rather than resisting change, we have decided to embrace it and move along 
                in the changed context. I welcome you to KMCT- come, be a part of this 
                change.
